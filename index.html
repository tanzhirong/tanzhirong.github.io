                        <p>I'm currently a Product Manager at ShopBack. Previously, I was part of the Industry Division at Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information, working on enterprise development, technology, and infocomm manpower policies to help build a vibrant digital economy. I graduated
                            from the University of Chicago with an M.S. in Statistics and B.S. in Mathematics (Specialization in Economics) in August 2019, focusing on unsupervised machine learning and computational statistics. </p>
                        <p>I am broadly interested in technology and economic policies, product development, and statistical analysis. I'm excited about using statistical tools to enhance decision-making in public policy, and enabling innovation
                            in the public service through digital tools.</p>
                        <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction, watching sitcoms, chasing franchise films (Star Wars, Marvel Cinematic Universe), and exploring the outdoors.</p>
