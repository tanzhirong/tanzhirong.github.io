	<p>I am an incoming Assistant Manager (Industry Division) at Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information, looking at innovation and tech capability development policies to grow Singapore's digital economy. I graduated from the University of Chicago with an M.S. in Statistics in August 2019, focusing on Unsupervised Machine Learning and Multivariate Statistical Inference. I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics (Specialization in Economics) with Phi Beta Kappa, also from UChicago, in June 2018. </p>
	<p>I am broadly interested in technology policy, product management, and user & operations analytics. Specifically, I'm excited about using computational and statistical tools to understand societal trends and enhance decision-making in public policy.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading nonfiction, watching sitcoms, chasing franchise films (such as Star Wars, Marvel Cinematic Universe), and exploring the outdoors. I've completed 5 half-marathons and 1 full marathon, and look forward to the next run soon.</p>
