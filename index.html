	<p>I am currently a M.S. Statistics candidate at the University of Chicago, and am broadly interested in topics such as unsupervised learning, causality in statistical learning, and the relationship between statistical analysis and decision-making in public policy. I graduated with B.S. in Mathematics (Specialization in Economics) with Phi Beta Kappa, also from the University of Chicago, in June 2018. </p>
	<p>Outside of academics, I'm interested in areas such as product management and technology policy. At my previous internships, I was with Shopee's Product Management team, Singapore's Smart Nation and Digital Government Office's Planning & Prioritization directorate, and Arcstone in Singapore.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading nonfiction, watching sitcoms and franchise films (such as Marvel Cinematic Universe), and exploring the outdoors. I've completed 5 half-marathons and 1 full marathon, and am looking forward to the next run soon, once I'm in better shape or feel the need to get into one, whichever is earlier.</p>
