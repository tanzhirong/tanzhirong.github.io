	<p>I am broadly interested in statistical learning, with specific interests in developing methods which leverage structure in the data or side information to yield better prediction and inference. I am also really interested in the relationship between statistical analyses and actual decision making, as well as how statistics is communicated to the public and in the classroom.</p>
