	<p>I am a third-year PhD student with Stanford's <a target="_blank" href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/">Rob Tibshirani</a>. I am broadly interested in statistical learning, with specific interests in developing methods which leverage structure in the data or side information to yield better prediction and inference. I am also really interested in the relationship between statistical analyses and actual decision making, as well as how statistics is communicated to the public and in the classroom.</p>

	<p>My past work experience has been with the Singapore Government. Most recently, I was a data scientist at IDA Singapore's Data Science Division (now under <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/">GovTech</a>), where I worked with various government agencies to analyze their data in suport of public policies and services. I also have previous experience in public policy with Singapore's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mewr.gov.sg/">Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources</a> and Ministry of Defence.</p>
