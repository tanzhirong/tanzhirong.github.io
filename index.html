	<p>I am currently an M.S. Statistics candidate at the University of Chicago, and am broadly interested in topics such as unsupervised learning, causality in statistical learning, and the relationship between statistical analysis and decision-making in public policy. I graduated with B.S. in Mathematics (Specialization in Economics) with Phi Beta Kappa, also from the University of Chicago, in June 2018. </p>
	<p>Outside of academia, I'm looking forward to explore opportunities in areas such as product management, user analytics, and technology policy. At my previous internships, I was with Shopee's Product Management team, Singapore's Smart Nation and Digital Government Office's Planning & Prioritization directorate, and Arcstone in Singapore.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading nonfiction, watching sitcoms, chasing franchise films (such as Marvel Cinematic Universe), and exploring the outdoors. I've completed 5 half-marathons and 1 full marathon, and look forward to the next run soon.</p>
