	<p>I am an incoming Assistant Manager (Industry Division) at Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information, looking at innovation and tech capability development policies to grow Singapore's Digital Economy. I graduated from the University of Chicago with an M.S. in Statistics in August 2019, focusing on Unsupervised Machine Learning and Multivariate Statistical Inference. I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics (Specialization in Economics) with Phi Beta Kappa, also from UChicago, in June 2018. </p>
		
	<p>I am broadly interested in technology policy, product management and user & operations analytics. Specifically, I'm excited about using computational and statistical tools to understand societal trends and enhance decision-making in public policies. My past projects include using statistical techniques to understand the changing trends in Western politics and the growth of housing and rental prices in major US cities.
	<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading nonfiction, watching sitcoms, chasing franchise films (such as Star Wars, Marvel Cinematic Universe), and exploring the outdoors. I've completed 5 half-marathons and 1 full marathon, and look forward to the next run soon.</p>
