<h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="airbnb.pdf">Spatial Modelling of Short-Term Rental Prices using Nonparametric Models</a></u></b></div>
<p>Processed the dataset of Airbnb listings in Chicago, and utilized nonparametric methods, such as the local polynomial regression and the additive model, to evaluate and predict the impact of location on Airbnb rental prices, when controlled for other variables. </p><br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="tic.pdf">Gun Violence Trauma-Informed Care Program Analysis</a></u></b></div>
<p>In effort to address the issue of gun violence on the South Side of Chicago, a new curriculum in Trauma Informed Care (TIC) was developed and taught to healthcare works at UChicago’s medical centers. The training consisted of modules on safety, avoiding re-traumatization, and discharge planning. As part of the Statistics Department's Consulting Program, my team investigated four questions: (1) whether there was a significant improvement from the program, (3) how a participant’s role, department, and training levels affects the improvement, (4) and which groups of people were most likely to complete both surveys. </p><br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="maxhr.html">Prediction of Maximum Heart Rate Attained during Exercise</a></u></b></div>
<p>Developed a model for understanding how a group of patients' maximum heart rate attained during an exercise trial is affected by their heart and physical health conditions. The data is obtained from Machine Learning Repository @ UCI. Performed model selection and cross validation to correct for issues such as nonlinear trends, collinearity and multiple testing, with a focus on rigorous statistical methods.</p><br>
