<h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
<i>Projects with a focus on statistical theories and methods.</i>
<br><br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="MultipleTesting.pdf">A Nested Group BH Approach to Online Hypothesis Testing</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Using the bikeshare data (a log of all bike trips in Washington DC from 2011 to 2012), my team identified possible over or undersupply of bicycles at every station for certain time periods. We introduced a new parametric model for the number departures
    and arrivals at each station, to conduct inference on the stability of stations in different periods and under different conditions. In order to correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we implemented a group BH procedure for each period as well as
    a LOND-type procedure to account for the online testing structure. Lastly, we utilized the information from the tests over the entire year of 2012 to perform a long run analysis, identifying trends and patterns.</p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="LDA_TopicModel.pdf">Comparison of Topic Modelling Methods on British Parliamentary Debates</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description"> We performed topic modelling of the British Parliamentary debates in 2 eras, 1990s and 2010s, using 3 methods – Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, before using a nonparametric method, t-SNE, to visualize
    and qualitatively analyze the results. </p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="Nonparametric_Analysis.pdf">Spatial Modelling of Short-Term Rental Prices using Nonparametric Models</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Processed the dataset of Airbnb listings in Chicago, and utilized nonparametric methods, such as the local polynomial regression and the additive model, to evaluate and predict the impact of location on Airbnb rental prices, when controlled for other
    variables. </p>
<br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="TIC.pdf">Gun Violence Trauma-Informed Care Program Analysis</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">In effort to address the issue of gun violence on the South Side of Chicago, a new curriculum in Trauma Informed Care (TIC) was developed and taught to healthcare workers at UChicago’s medical centers. The training consisted of modules on safety, avoiding
    re-traumatization, and discharge planning. As part of the Statistics Department's Consulting Program, my team investigated 3 questions: (1) whether there was a significant improvement from the program, (2) how a participant’s role, department, and
    training levels affects the improvement, (3) and which groups of people were most likely to complete both surveys. </p>

<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
<i>Some data analysis and exploration projects.</i><br><br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="BeerReviewsAnalysis.html">Beer Reviews Analysis</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">WIP</p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="EMAlgorithmMNIST.html">EM Algorithms</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">WIP</p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="MNIST_analysis.html">Unsupervised Learning Applications</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">What if our dataset is corrupted? Using a noisy MNIST dataset, we explored nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Kernel PCA, t-SNE (parametric and nonparametric) and Isomap, to visualize the dataset and improve
    classification accuracy. </p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="clustering.html">Clustering Methods on Wikipedia Articles</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Utilized several clustering methods to cluster Wikipedia articles and ensure they fall under the correct categories and subcategories.</p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="maxhr.html">Prediction of Maximum Heart Rate Attained during Exercise</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Developed a model for understanding how a group of patients' maximum heart rate attained during an exercise trial is affected by their heart and physical health conditions. The data is obtained from Machine Learning Repository @ UCI. Performed model selection
    and cross validation to correct for issues such as nonlinear trends, collinearity and multiple testing, with a focus on rigorous statistical methods.</p>
