<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="Airbnb_RentalPrediction.pdf">Spatial Modelling of Short-Term Rental Prices using Nonparametric Models</a></u></b></div>
<p>I made use of a few nonparametric methods, such as local polynomial regression, and the additive model, to evaluate the impact of location on Airbnb rental prices.</p><br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="maxhr.html">Prediction of Maximum Heart Rate Attained during Exercise</a></u></b></div>
<p>I seek to understand a dataset of patients with certain heart and physical health conditions. The aim is to build a model for the response maxhr (maximum heart rate attained during exericse) based on the physical conditions of the participants. The data is obtained from Machine Learning Repository @ UCI.</p><br>
