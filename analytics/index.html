<h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
<i>Projects with a focus on statistical theories and methods.</i>
<br><br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="multipletesting.pdf">A Nested Group BH Approach to Online Hypothesis Testing</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Using the bikeshare data (a log of all bike trips in Washington DC from 2011 to 2012), we seek to identify possible over or undersupply of bicycles at every station for certain time periods. We introduced a new parametric model for the number departures and arrivals at each station, to conduct inference on the stability of stations in different periods and under different conditions. In order to correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we implemented a group BH procedure for each period as well as a LOND-type procedure to account for the online testing structure. Lastly, we utilized the information from the tests over the entire year of 2012 to perform a long run analysis, identifying trends and patterns.</p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="lda_topicmodel.pdf">Comparison of Topic Modelling Methods on British Parliamentary Debates</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description"> We performed topic modelling of the British Parliamentary debates in 2 eras, 1990s and 2010s, using 3 methods – Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, before using a nonparametric method, t-SNE, to visualize and qualitatively analyze the results. </p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="airbnb.pdf">Spatial Modelling of Short-Term Rental Prices using Nonparametric Models</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Processed the dataset of Airbnb listings in Chicago, and utilized nonparametric methods, such as the local polynomial regression and the additive model, to evaluate and predict the impact of location on Airbnb rental prices, when controlled for other variables. </p>
<br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="tic.pdf">Gun Violence Trauma-Informed Care Program Analysis</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">In effort to address the issue of gun violence on the South Side of Chicago, a new curriculum in Trauma Informed Care (TIC) was developed and taught to healthcare workers at UChicago’s medical centers. The training consisted of modules on safety, avoiding re-traumatization, and discharge planning. As part of the Statistics Department's Consulting Program, my team investigated 3 questions: (1) whether there was a significant improvement from the program, (2) how a participant’s role, department, and training levels affects the improvement, (3) and which groups of people were most likely to complete both surveys. </p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="maxhr.html">Prediction of Maximum Heart Rate Attained during Exercise</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Developed a model for understanding how a group of patients' maximum heart rate attained during an exercise trial is affected by their heart and physical health conditions. The data is obtained from Machine Learning Repository @ UCI. Performed model selection and cross validation to correct for issues such as nonlinear trends, collinearity and multiple testing, with a focus on rigorous statistical methods.</p>

<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
<i>Some data analysis and exploration projects.</i><br><br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="sotu.html">Analysis of State of the Union Speeches</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">A quick look at how US's State of the Union addresses have evolved in length and speech structure since 1790, and across presidents.</p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="MNIST_1.html">MNIST Analysis with PCA + CCA</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">What if our data is corrupted? Using noisy MNIST data, we explore how methods such as principal component analysis and canonical correlation analysis help to improve classification of noisy data.</p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="MNIST_2.html">MNIST Analysis with Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Explored nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, such as Variational Autoencoders, Kernel PCA, t-SNE (parametric and nonparametric), and Isomap to visualize and improve classification accuracy of MNIST data.</p>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="clustering.html">Clustering Methods on Wikipedia Articles</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Utilized several clustering methods to cluster Wikipedia articles and ensure they fall under the correct categories and subcategories.</p>
