            <i>June - September 2018 </i></div>
    <td width="80%">
      <p class="exp_description">During my 3 months there, I owned 4 product features, from conceptualization and testing to live deployment. I designed wireframes using HTML and CSS, and authored use cases to communicate product requirements to stakeholders. Specific features include improving the platform’s category trees and attributes system, enhancing product listing pages through 2-tier variations and customization, and automating Quality Control solutions. </p>
      <p class="exp_description">My team provided me with both the freedom and guidance to explore different approaches when resolving a product issue. It was exhilarating witnessing the growth of one of Southeast Asia's largest ecommerce platforms, and working with talented colleagues across various departments and from 7 different countries, to identify customers’ pain-points through market research, industry best practices, and hands-on experimentation.</p>

            <i>June - August 2017 </i></div>
    <td width="80%">
      <p class="exp_description">I began my internship at a time when the office was just newly formed to attain Singapore’s goal of becoming a Smart Nation. As part of my division’s role in prioritizing and planning the next phase of Singapore’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.opengovasia.com/singapores-smart-nation-strategic-projects-on-track-to-deliver-interim-outcomes/">Smart Nation Strategic Projects</a>, I investigated the potential of a proposed government-to-business data and microservices platform by examining Singaporean companies’ pain-points with G2B online transactions. I also completed an international scan on the use of big data and artificial intelligence in population healthcare, with a proposal on data collection procedures, and data-sharing requirements.</p>
      <p class="exp_description">Furthermore, I assisted my colleague with research on the UAE’s Smart Dubai Initiative, drawing parallels to Singapore’s Smart Nation plan, and gathering possible opportunities for collaboration, in preparation for an upcoming department’s study trip.</p>

        <div class="project_title">Startup Intern<br>
            <i>July - September 2016 </i></div>
    <td width="80%">
      <p class="exp_description">My time at Arcstone, a firm specializing in industrial manufacturing analytics, made me realized how much I enjoy working at a startup – from having to juggle multiple hats, to the huge variety of learning experiences. I crafted Arcstone’s overall B2B marketing plan for local growth and regional expansion, revamped its online media branding and digital marketing framework, and devised a client feedback system to further integrate Arcstone’s marketing and product development processes.</p>
      <p class="exp_description">Despite having no formal computer science training, I learnt a new programming language, Visual Basic .NET from scratch in 2 weeks. For my main project, I enhanced the UI/UX design and data retrieval process of a module in Arcstone’s software platform using VB .NET and DevExpress. Finally, I had the chance to establish contacts with government agencies for project collaborations, engage with potential clients and communicate their manufacturing needs in project reports for management.</p>

    <td width="80%">
      <p class="exp_description">My supervisors at Shopbolt, a Sears ecommerce platform, gave me complete autonomy in my tasks. I modified and revamped their existing database in Excel, implemented the Google Analytics platform on their main site and blog in order to understand user engagement, purchasing funnels, and identify growth opportunities. I took ownership of Shopbolt’s data analytics, spearheading projects like market basket analysis, product category analysis, and sequential ordering evaluation to design cross-selling and sales promotions.</p>
      <p class="exp_description">With my past experiences in SEO, I also worked with the web developers on implementing SEO strategies on Shopbolt’s blog, and proposed methods to improve their website architecture after performing keyword research and site user behavior analysis.</p>

        <i>July - September 2015</i></div>
    <td width="80%">
      <p class="exp_description">I learnt so much in my first internship at a startup, and my first dip into Singapore’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. At LessonsGoWhere, Singapore’s online marketplace for offline lessons, I handled responsibilities across digital marketing, business operations, and sales. I conducted a market study of Singapore’s recreational lessons industry to support startup’s expansion plans, directed weekly electronic direct marketing campaigns, and worked with a governmental organization in planning a video marketing campaign for SG50.</p>
      <p class="exp_description">In addition, I assisted with the backend server management, handled vendors’ liaison, customer relations, and B2B corporate sales. The time spent chatting with potential customers, reacting to different styles of customer feedback, and making hundreds of calls looking for sponsorship, made me recognize the immense grit required for success, and fulfillment of working in a startup when every little effort count.</p>

      <p class="exp_description">My first civil service and public policy experience.
