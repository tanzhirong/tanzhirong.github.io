        <td width="77%">
            <p class="exp_description">My time at Arcstone, a firm specialising in industrial manufacturing analytics, made me realized how much I enjoy working at a startup – from having to juggle multiple hats, to the variety in learning experiences. I crafted Arcstone’s overall
                B2B marketing plan for local growth and regional expansion, revamped its online media branding and digital marketing framework, and devised a client feedback system to further integrate Arcstone’s marketing and product development processes.
            </p>
            <p class="exp_description">Despite having no formal computer science training, I learnt a new programming language, Visual Basic .NET from scratch in 2 weeks. For my main project, I enhanced the UI/UX design and data retrieval process of a module in Arcstone’s software
                platform using mySQL, VB .NET and DevExpress.

            <p class="exp_description">At LessonsGoWhere, Singapore’s online marketplace for offline lessons, I handled responsibilities across digital marketing, business operations, and sales. I conducted a market study of Singapore’s recreational lessons industry to support
                startup’s expansion plans, directed weekly electronic direct marketing campaigns, and worked with a governmental organization in planning a video marketing campaign for SG50.</p>
            <p class="exp_description">In addition, I managed backend server operations, vendors’ liaison, customer relations, and B2B corporate sales. The time spent engaging potential customers, and making hundreds of cold calls looking for sponsorship, made me recognize the
