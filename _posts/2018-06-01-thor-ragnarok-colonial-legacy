Since the success of The Avengers in 2012, Marvel Studios has found itself in a unique position. It has a huge fan base, and had previously attempted to discuss controversial issues in its films, from the concern of the surveillance state in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), to American imperialism in Avengers: Age of Ultron. However, given the need to cater to the preferences of causal movie goers, many of its films consciously avoided any real political engagement.

Yet, this all changed with Thor: Ragnarok. Thor: Ragnarok is a tale of colonialism, a space fantasy that questions the west about their centuries-long inclination to sweep their colonial history under a rug and refusal to learn from it. The core of the Thor trilogy revolves around the notion of empire; the franchise has built on Asgard as an imperial power tasked with the responsibility of bringing order to the “nine realms”.
