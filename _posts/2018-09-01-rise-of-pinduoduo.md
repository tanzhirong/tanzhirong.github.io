This July, I embarked on an Economics summer program at Fudan University in Shanghai. It had been 8 years since I last stepped into China. While I was looking forward to the new experiences at Fudan, my primary intention for the trip was to understand more about the Chinese tech phenomenon. Although China has been accused of IP infringement by the United States, she has been the source of most consumer innovation we witness today. More startling is how quickly the transition has occurred.

Because of my Singaporean phone number, I could not immediately link my credit card to WeChat, and the only method of financial transaction was carrying a thick stack of RMB 100 notes, just like I once did as a secondary school student while on exchange in Beijing. Despite my best attempts at imitating a local accent, the RMB 100 notes are the clearest indication that I am not a local, and occasionally I faced judgmental looks from the cashiers when I fumbled with the bills to pay for my meals. Since the route from my hotel to school was 20 minutes by foot, imagine my frustration when I could not use my phone to call a Didi, or to unlock one of the orange and yellow bicycles that reflect Chinaâ€™s bike-sharing culture. Thankfully, my WeChat wallet worked after a few days, and I slowly recognized how exhilarating and easy it is to be part of this online environment.
