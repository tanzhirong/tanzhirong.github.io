        <p>The product was designed during the Chicago Campus 1871 hackathon, where my team conceptualized a project and experimental learning tool for middle and high school students. Below are wireframe designs of the platform.

        <div class="project_title"><b><u>The Real Black Card</u></b></div>
<p>As part of the Polsky Small Business Growth Program, my team and I advised a Chicago firm specializing in affiliate marketing. We	conducted user research with local consumers and Chicago’s small businesses to design a partnership incentive program. We also created a technology implementation model and conceptualized functionalities for a digital customer loyalty app.
        
        <p>Below are some wireframes for the digital customer loyalty app. A summary of our research and presentation can be found <a target="_blank" href="rbc.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<br>
<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="transport.pdf">Imagining the Future of Mobility in Singapore</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">Singapore’s current transport system faces three major challenges: a growing population that places pressure on the transport network, infrastructural limitations that manifest themselves in infrastructural breakdowns and inadequate crisis management, and higher expectations from Singaporean residents regarding the convenience, reliability and comprehensiveness of the public transport system. As such, our paper outlines a framework for the integration of infrastructure and information within a ‘smart’ transport network. The framework combines a tripartite system incorporating alternative vehicular technologies and modalities, such as electric cars and ride-sharing, with a decentralized, dense IoT network that provides publicly available data analysis and visualisation.</p>
<br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="healthcare.pdf">Application of Technologies and Data Regulation in Modern Healthcare</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">In the presentation, we investigate how countries around the world are using technologies to enhance population healthcare. First, we give an overview of the ways different types of technologies have been applied in modern healthcare, before proceeding with implications of these technologies with respect to the regulation and protection of healthcare data. Thereafter, we focus on case studies in Australia, UK and USA on the use of artificial intelligence in population health, concluding with a discussion of how Singapore can be better equipped to leverage on these technologies.</p>
<br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="pinduoduo.pdf">China’s Tech Ecosystem and the Rise of Pinduoduo</a></u></b></div>
<p class="exp_description">The essay discusses the role of social media in the rise and success of Pinduoduo, a Chinese ecommerce platform. Given that both Southeast Asia and China are mobile-first and contain rural regions coming online at an exponential pace, tracking how Pinduoduo attempts to overcome its challenges will be valuable to Southeast Asia’s e-commerce ecosystem. I argue that 3 integredients - social connectivity, mobile penetration, and a unified digital payments system must be present in Southeast Asia before the region is ready for a business concept like social e-commerce to flourish.</p>

<h2>Games</h2>
<p>I created several games using Python, during an online course on interactive programming. Below are 2 of particular interest to me.</p>
<br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <div class="project_title"><b><u>Black Jack</u></b></div>
    <td width="40%">
        <p>Made in python with pygame and simplegui packages. Card images obtained from simplegui package in codeskulptor. May consider editing the game to be multiplayer when I have the time.</p>
