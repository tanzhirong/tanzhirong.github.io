<table>
    <tr>
        <div class="project_title"><b><u>BridgED</u></b></div>
        <p>The product was designed during the Chicago Campus 1871 hackathon, where my team conceptualized a project and experimental learning tool for middle and high school students. Below are wireframe designs of the platform.

        <div class="project_title"><b><u>The Real Black Card</u></b></div>
<p>As part of the Polsky Small Business Growth Program, my team and I advised a Chicago firm specializing in affiliate marketing. We	conducted user research with local consumers and Chicagoâ€™s small businesses to design a partnership incentive program. We also created a technology implementation model and conceptualized functionalities for a digital customer loyalty app.
        
        <p>Below are some wireframes for the digital customer loyalty app. A summary of our research and presentation can be found <a target="_blank" href="rbc.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Statistical Analysis</h2>
<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="Airbnb_RentalPrediction.pdf">Spatial Modelling of Short-Term Rental Prices using Nonparametric Models</a></u></b></div>
<p>I made use of a few nonparametric methods, such as local polynomial regression, and the additive model, to evaluate the impact of location on Airbnb rental prices.</p><br>
<br>

<div class="project_title"><b><u><a target="_blank" href="HeartDataAnalysis_ZhiRongTan.html">Prediction of Maximum Heart Rate Attained during Exercise</a></u></b></div>
<p>I seek to understand a dataset of patients with certain heart and physical health conditions. The aim is to build a model for the response maxhr (maximum heart rate attained during exericse) based on the physical conditions of the participants. The data is obtained from Machine Learning Repository @ UCI.</p><br>

<h2>Games</h2>
<p>I created several games using Python, during an online course on interactive programming. Below are 2 of particular interest to me.</p>
<br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <div class="project_title"><b><u>Black Jack</u></b></div>
    <td width="40%">
        <p>Made in python with pygame and simplegui packages. Card images obtained from simplegui package in codeskulptor. May consider editing the game to be multiplayer when I have the time.</p>
        <p>Code available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tanzhirong/Python-Projects-Games/blob/master/BlackJack_Edited081118.py">here</a>.</p>
